Here are the extracted questions from both PDF files:

### **MLOps Sessional-I (Spring-2024).pdf**

**Question 1 (6 marks)**  
(a) Provide an example of YAML code to trigger a GitHub Actions workflow only when a pull request is opened or updated on the main branch.  
(b) Describe the syntax for defining multiple jobs in a GitHub Actions workflow YAML file, each responsible for different stages of the CI process, such as testing and linting.  
(c) Provide YAML code to define a GitHub Actions workflow that runs tests in parallel across multiple operating systems, such as Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows.

**Question 2 (10 marks)**  
(a) Describe the difference between Docker images and Docker containers.  
(b) Walk through the process of creating a Dockerfile for a Python Flask application.  
(c) Explain how Docker layers work and their implications for image size and caching during builds.  
(d) What is the purpose of a Docker registry, and how does it differ from Docker Hub?  
(e) Explain the concept of port mapping in Docker containers and its significance in containerized applications. Provide an example scenario where port mapping is essential and discuss how it is implemented within Docker.

**Question 3 (5 marks)**  
You’re managing a Python web application hosted on GitHub, and you want to automate its CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions and Docker containerization. Your goal is to build the Python web application into a Docker image and push it to Docker Hub whenever changes are pushed to the main branch. Write a GitHub Actions workflow YAML file that achieves this objective, including steps for building the Docker image, tagging it appropriately, and pushing it to Docker Hub.

### **MLOps Sessional-II (Fall-2024).pdf**

**Question 1 (5 marks)**  
You have developed a Flask-based Python application that listens on port 8080, with the source code located in a local "app" folder. This application relies on two microservices: a private login service (myrepo/login-service:latest) that listens on port 8081, and a MySQL database, where the login service retrieves data from the MySQL database to operate. Since a Docker image for your Python application has not yet been created, how can you utilize Docker Compose to run your application along with its dependencies? Write the YAML configuration while considering relevant DevOps principles applied to this context.

**Question 2 (10 marks)**  
(a) You are tasked with setting up an automated build process for an application that can be compiled for different platforms: Windows, macOS, and Linux. Each platform requires distinct build commands and tools. The team would like to initiate builds from Jenkins but needs a way to specify which platform to target for each build. How would you configure your Jenkins job to facilitate this requirement?  
(b) You are responsible for maintaining a Jenkins pipeline that automates the deployment of a web application. The deployment process includes a step where a custom version tag must be applied to the build artifacts. The development team frequently releases new versions, and they want to include a specific version identifier or release note with each deployment. The team would like to trigger the deployment job in Jenkins and provide a custom text string that represents the version identifier or release note for that deployment. This string should be included in the deployment metadata and displayed in the application's dashboard after deployment. How would you set up your Jenkins job to enable the development team to specify a version identifier or release note for each deployment, ensuring that this information is used in the deployment process?

**Additional content in PDF:**  
The later pages appear to contain YAML examples for Kubernetes configurations (Secrets, ConfigMap, Deployment, Service), but no explicit question is attached to them in the provided text.
